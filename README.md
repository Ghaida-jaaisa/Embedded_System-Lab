### LAB 1 || [Open Folder](./PIC/LAB_1/)
#### TASK #1 || [Open File](./PIC/LAB_1/TASK%20#1)
Task1: Connect the leds to the PIC programmer. Turn on the four left leds and turn off the four right leds for 0.5 seconds. Then keep alternating between the right and left leds.

### LAB 2 -- Leds and switches
#### TASK #1  
Task1: Connect the leds to PORTD and turn on one of the leds. The led is shifted/rotated to the left every 400 ms. You have to use the C << operation.

#### TASK #2  
Task2: Connect the leds to PORTD and the switches to PORTC and blink all leds every 0.3 second. Each time button RC0 is pressed, the switching time is increased by 100 ms. Each time button RC1 is pressed, the switching time is decreased by 100 ms.

### LAB 3 -- 7 Segment
#### TASK #0  
Show the number 59 for 3 seconds then turn off the display.

#### TASK #1  
Show the number 44 for three seconds then turn off the display.

#### TASK #2  
Show the numbers 00, 10, 20, ....90, 00, etc. Change the number every 0.6 Seconds.

#### TASK #3  
Connect the switches and combo board and display the number 4. Each time SW6 is pressed, the number is incremented (up to 9). Each time SW7 is pressed, the number is decremented (down to 0).

### LAB 4 - Report #4 (Keypad and interrupts)
#### TASK #1  
Use the keypad such that key 2 and key 5 turn on/off all leds.

#### TASK #2  
Use the keypad such that:
- Key 5 turns on LED number 5  
- Key 6 turns on LED number 6  
- The `*` button turns on all leds

#### TASK #3  
Blink all leds every 0.8 second. Use interrupts such that:
- Push button 0 increases the blinking time by 100 ms  
- Push button 2 decreases the blinking time by 100 ms
