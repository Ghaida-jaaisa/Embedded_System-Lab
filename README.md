### LAB 2
#### TASK #1 
Task1: Connect the leds to PORTD and turn on one of the leds. The led is shifted/rotated to the left every 400 ms . You have to use the C << operation.
#### TASK #2
Task2: Connect the leds to PORTD and the switches to PORTC and blink all leds every 0.3 second. Each time button RC0 is pressed, the switching time is increased by 100 ms. Each time button RC1 is pressed, the switching time is decreased by 100 ms.
